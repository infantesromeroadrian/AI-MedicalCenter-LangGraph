      "content": "Assessment of Symptoms:\nThe symptom of itching on the arm, known as pruritus, can be caused by a variety of conditions. It is important to consider both dermatological and systemic causes.\n\nPotential Causes or Differential Diagnoses:\n1. **Dermatological Causes:**\n   - **Contact Dermatitis:** Reaction to an irritant or allergen that has come into contact with the skin.\n   - **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis):** A chronic condition characterized by itchy, inflamed skin.\n   - **Psoriasis:** An autoimmune condition that causes red, scaly patches on the skin.\n   - **Insect Bites:** Such as mosquito or flea bites, which can cause localized itching.\n\n2. **Systemic Causes:**\n   - **Allergic Reactions:** To foods, medications, or other allergens.\n   - **Liver or Kidney Disease:** These can cause generalized itching due to toxin buildup.\n   - **Diabetes:** Poorly controlled diabetes can lead to dry skin and itching.\n\nRecommendations for the Patient:\n- **Initial Self-Care:**\n  - Apply a moisturizing lotion or cream to the affected area to prevent dryness.\n  - Use over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream to reduce inflammation and itching.\n  - Avoid scratching to prevent skin damage and potential infection.\n  - Identify and avoid potential irritants or allergens that may have caused the reaction.\n\n- **When to Seek Medical Attention:**\n  - If the itching persists for more than a few days or is severe.\n  - If there are additional symptoms such as rash, swelling, or signs of infection (redness, warmth, pus).\n  - If you suspect a systemic cause, such as liver or kidney issues, or if you have a known chronic condition like diabetes.\n\n- **Follow-Up:**\n  - If symptoms persist or worsen, consider consulting a dermatologist for a thorough evaluation and possible allergy testing.\n  - If systemic causes are suspected, follow up with your primary care physician for further investigation and management.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Apply moisturizing lotion and over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream.\n- Avoid scratching and identify potential irritants.\n- Seek medical attention if symptoms persist, worsen, or if there are additional concerning symptoms.\n\nSOURCES:\n- American Academy of Dermatology guidelines on managing pruritus.\n- Mayo Clinic resources on common causes of itching.",
